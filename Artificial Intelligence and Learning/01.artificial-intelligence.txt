Artificial Intelligence. Goals. Machine learning: Supervised, unsupervised and semisupervised learning. Types of approaches.

1. General:
- [Data Mining]:
    Extract certain key features or metrics from data. Algorithms vary depending on the data domain.
- [Machine Learning]:
    Study and learn from data sets in order to discover patterns and predict future patterns.
- [Real-time Processing]:
    Also called "Stream Processing". New hardware capabilities make it possible to process now data in real-time.
    Data is processed, queried and analyzed immediately, unlike [batch processing], which stores data for later processing in bulk.
- [Graph Processing]:
    Many domains can be represented as graphs, as this resembles their natural features.
